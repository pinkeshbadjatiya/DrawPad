# DrawPad
A digital chalkboard.
It is a simple web-based app built using `php`, `javascript` and `svg`.It can be used as a black board to draw/write stuff which can be viewed by the client in REALTIME. He can even make notes of the draw-board and text content as screenshot which gets saved locally, which can then be exported to PDF for reference.

`mouse.php` -  Server page  
`client_new.php` - Client page  

#### Note:
1. Do not change the name of main directory. It should be 'DrawPad'.
2. If images do not save then check the permission of the 'mouse.php' and 'client_new.php'
3. If SVG's dont save, then check the permission and ownership of the directory.
